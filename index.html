                    The Crown Chakra, also known as the 7th Chakra or <i>Sahasrara</i> Chakra, is the gateway to your higher power and enlightenment. It’s considered the most spiritual of all chakras and is responsible for your connection with universal consciousness. When you work with your Sahasrara Chakra, you can open yourself to more synchronicities, stronger intuition, and deeper faith in your personal beliefs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ready to learn more? Before we dive into the <a href="https://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/chakras-yoga-for-beginners/intro-sahasrara-crown-chakra/#:~:text=The%20crown%20chakra%20in%20its,unity%2C%20and%20self%2Dknowledge.">Crown Chakra</a> meaning, it may help to understand some chakra basics for context. Chakras are special areas that exist in the subtle body, which is believed to be a “layer” of metaphysical energy just beyond our physical form. The subtle body is where we process our prana, also known as chi or life-force energy. Many people believe that the prana in our subtle body plays a vital role in spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical wellness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although there are multiple chakras within the subtle body, most chakra healing revolves around the seven “primary chakras” located along the spine. These chakras help regulate the energy traveling up and down this important channel and each one is responsible for specific emotions, personality traits, physical features, and other qualities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Together we maintain a balanced flow of energy. When they are properly aligned, the seven chakras ensure that we receive the perfect balance of energy - not too much or too little - to help us thrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept of chakras originates from ancient Indian spiritual texts, however, anyone can work with the chakras to bring greater balance into their lives. Even if you do not have strong spiritual beliefs, the chakra system can be viewed as a powerful metaphor to support personal growth. The techniques used in Crown Chakra healing and other chakra work will bring positive benefits to your life no matter who you are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how do you balance this chakra? In this blog, we'll discuss everything you need to know how to begin healing this chakra.

                <h3>Sahasrara: The Crown Chakra or 7th Chakra</h3>
                <p>
                    This chakra is located just above the crown of the head. It's the seventh and final chakra in the primary chakra system and is sometimes referred to as the head chakra or purple chakra. In Sanskrit, it is known as the Sahasrara Chakra, which roughly translates to “thousand-petalled.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spirituality is the key force of this chakra. Many believe that the Crown Chakra is the point where our earthly self merges with our higher self. It functions as a gateway for deepening our connection to faith, divine wisdom, and spiritual enlightenment. When properly aligned, this chakra allows us to see with greater clarity and perspective. It also helps us feel more connected on a spiritual level to other people, animals, plants, and subtle energies in the world around us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An open Crown Chakra also allows us to manifest our dreams into reality. It lets us tune into our spiritual intuition, feel closer to our higher power, and understand our role in the universe beyond material pursuits. If you find yourself feeling disconnected from your faith or stuck in the mundane business of daily living, working with your crown can bring your soul and mind back into balance. Overtime, Crown Chakra meditation and other healing work may help you reach enlightenment.
                </p>
                <h4>Key Characteristics of the 7th Chakra</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>See the Beauty in the World:</b> This Chakra allows you to see the beauty and divinity in all things.</li>
                    <li><b>Unity:</b> The 7th Chakra represents your connection to the universe and helps you experience unity with everyone and everything around you.</li>
                    <li><b>Awareness:</b> This Chakra elevates your conciousness to a higher level, allowing your awareness to become transcendent.</li>
                    <li><b>Enlightenment:</b> The Crown Chakra is the gateway between the physical and cosmic self, which can bring clarity, wisdom, and enlightenment.</li>
                    <li><b>Serenity & Bliss:</b> When properly balanced, you'll feel deeper levels of serenity, joy, and peace through this chakra.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How To Align Your Crown Chakra</h3>
                <p>
                    When this chakra is out of alignment, you may feel cut off from your spirituality. A misaligned Crown Chakra can also cause you to worry too much or become focused on material problems beyond your control. You may also feel overly sensitive, depressed, or disillusioned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're working on self-improvement and personal or spiritual growth, it's important to heal this chakra and bring it into balance. To begin, start by identifying whether your 7th Chakra is underactive or overacted.
                </p>
                <h4>Underactive Sahasrara Chakra </h4>
                <p>
                    When a chakra is underactive, it means that the chakra is experiencing a blockage or is not distributing the flow of energy. When the 7th Chakra is blocked or underactive, it can hinder your ability to let go of materialistic needs. It can also cause you to feel detached or numbed from the world around you.
                </p>
                <h4>Signs of an Underactive Crown Chakra:</h4>
                <p>
                    This chakra may be blocked if you find yourself experiencing...
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A lack of inspiration</li>
                    <li>Greed and materialism</li>
                    <li>Brain fog</li>
                    <li>Cynicism and pessimism</li>
                    <li>Judgment of others</li>
                    <li>Feeling life is pointless or empty</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Overactive Sahasrara Chakra</h4>
                <p>
                    When a chakra is overactive, it means it is distributing too much energy. Whereas an underactive Crown Chakra cuts you off from your spiritual self, an overactive 7th Chakra does the opposite. You may feel as if your head is in the clouds and neglect your physical needs. An overly open head chakra may also contribute to egotism or feeling superior over others.
                </p>
                <h4>Signs of an Overactive Crown Chakra:</h4>
                <p>
                    If this chakra is too active, you may experience...
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disinterest in the world around you</li>
                    <li>Apathy toward other people's problems</li>
                    <li>Superiority and elitism</li>
                    <li>Disconnection from your physical body</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Bringing Balance to the Sahasrara Chakra</h3>
                <p>
                    Chakra balancing is the process of restoring the harmonious and balanced flow of prana or energy throughout the body. Your chakras are in constant fluctuation. Practicing chakra balancing and aligning is a regular and sometimes daily activity to explore. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of our favorite methods to balance this chakra include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Letting go</li>
                    <li>Spending time outdoors</li>
                    <li>Yoga</li>
                    <li>Crown Chakra meditation</li>
                    <li>Crown Chakra crystals</li>
                    <li>Aromatherapy</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How does letting go balance Crown Chakra?</h4>
                <p>
                    Try writing down any materialistic desires that may be holding you back. Practice living a more minimalist life by donating or selling items you no longer use. If past experiences are holding you back, list them on a piece of paper and safely burn it to symbolically release those experiences. Once you are able to move past your materialistic and earthly needs, you will be able to restore more balance to this chakra.
                </p>
                <h4>Does spending time outside help with Crown Chakra healing?</h4>
                <p>
                    This chakra is responsible for your connection to everything around you. By spending more time outdoors, you’ll feel more connected with the world and everything in it. If you can, try to spend a few minutes each day with your feet in the grass, touch a tree, or hike up to a hill or mountain with an expansive natural view. Make sure to put your phone or other electronic devices on “silent” and allow yourself to focus exclusively on your surroundings.
                </p>
                <h4>What are the best Crown Chakra yoga poses?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yoga is an important tool in bringing balance to this chakra. Yoga poses for this Chakra should focus on inversions or restorative movements to encourage energy to flow to the head. Here are some of our favorite yoga poses and movements to connect you to the energy of your Crown:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lotus | Padmasana</li>
                    <li>Reclining Bound Angle | Supta Baddha Konasana</li>
                    <li>Supported Headstand | Salamba Sirsasana</li>
                    <li>Tree Pose | Vrksasana</li>

                <h4>How can I meditate to support my 7th Chakra?</h4>
                <p>
                    Meditation plays an important role in restoring balance to your chakras, especially your 7th Chakra. Chakra meditation techniques are similar to traditional meditation techniques but focus on a specific area of the body. Below is a simple meditation technique to aid in balancing your Sahasrara:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sit with your shoulders back and spine straight. Relax your muscles as you close your eyes and breathe deeply. Inhale through your nose and exhale through the mouth.</li>
                    <li>Focus your attention on the crown of your head.</li>
                    <li>Since the Crown Chakra color is purple, imagine a violet light glowing at the crown of your head, slowly expanding upwards, making the whole area warm and relaxed. Rest in this sensation for 3-5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>When you are ready, slowly open your eyes.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>What affirmations are good for the 7th Chakra?</h4>
                <p>
                    Positive affirmations are a simple yet powerful way to release negative thoughts and emotions that may be locking this final chakra. When you are working with the energies of this chakra, spend a few moments each day looking the mirror and repeating these affirmations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I honor the divine within me</li>
                    <li>I listen to the wisdom of the universe</li>
                    <li>I am open to divine wisdom</li>
                    <li>I am at peace</li>
                    <li>I live in the present moment</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>What are the best Crown Chakra crystals?</h4>
                <p>
                    Each chakra is influenced by unique stones and their energetic properties. The 7th Chakra is highly influenced by clear quartz. When balancing your head chakra, meditate with clear quartz, carry the stone with you, or wear jewelry with clear quartz to let the energetic properties help restore balance to the chakra.
                </p>
                <h4>Clear Quartz Rollerball</h4>
                <p>

                </p>
